# Kernel: saxpy

Write a device kernel that calculates the single precision BLAS operation
**saxpy**, i.e. `y = a * x + y`.

Initialise the vectors with some values on the CPU and confirm the correctness
of the calculation, e.g. by comparing to reference values calculated on the
CPU or by printing out the results.

You may start from a skeleton code provided in [saxpy.cpp](saxpy.cpp).
