The purpose of this exercise is to compare 6 different memory management
strategies and their computational overhead. The following functions are
called at the end of this file by the `main()` function:

* `explicitMem();`
* `explicitMemPinned();`
* `explicitMemNoCopy();`
* `unifiedMem();`
* `unifiedMemPrefetch();`
* `unifiedMemNoCopy();`

The task is to fill the blanks indicated by: `#error`
