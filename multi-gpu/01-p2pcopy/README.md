# Peer to peer device access

Benchmark memory copies with and without peer to peer device access using two
GPUs.

Skeleton code [p2pcopy.cpp](p2pcopy.cpp) tests peer to peer device access
between two GPUs by doing a series of memory copies with and without peer to
peer access. The program prints calculated bandwith and time for both cases.
In order to make the code work, you need to fix the missing parts marked with
TODOs.
